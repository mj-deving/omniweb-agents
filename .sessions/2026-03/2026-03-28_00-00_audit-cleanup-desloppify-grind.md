# Session: Audit Cleanup + Desloppify Grind to 81.7

**Date:** 2026-03-28 00:00
**Duration:** ~5 hours
**Mode:** full
**Working Directory:** /home/USER/projects/omniweb-agents

## Summary

Resolved all 28 pre-packaging audit findings (Tier 1 + Tier 2 + desloppify queue), then ground through 3 full desloppify review-fix-review cycles. Score went from 81/100 baseline to 81.7 strict with 102 new tests. All work on `desloppify/code-health` branch, ready for PR.

## Work Done

- Fixed 3 Critical/High security findings: DNS rebinding pin (`createPinnedFetch`), atomic spend cap (`reservePaySpend` with UUID rollback), chain-first tip resolution with 5s RPC timeout
- Fixed 6 Medium security findings: file perms 0o600, URL sanitization, getDemos gate, DAHR 30s timeout, 128-bit hash keys, single-pass proto pollution reviver
- Fixed 12 code quality items: TxModule interface, typed SigningHandle, required discoverSources session, 3 new test files (state-helpers, discover-sources, verify-timers)
- Fixed 14 desloppify queue items: required attestUrl, injectable API URL, consolidated guards via appendEntry, barrel exports
- Ran /simplify (3 agents): 8 fixes — hoisted pinnedFetch, UUID rollback, safeParse reviver, RPC timeout
- Ran Fabric review_code: 6 fixes — IPv6 pinned-fetch, dead import, D402 error sanitize, @throws docs, optional queryTransaction, appendEntry abstraction
- Ran Fabric summarize_git_diff: generated session-level commit summary
- Desloppify R1 (4 agents): extracted shared feed parser, deprecated 6 guard compat exports, created DemosRpcMethods/D402ClientLike typed interfaces, removed dead code, fixed provenance responseHash
- Desloppify R2 (2 agents): static safeParse import, domain filter wiring, lazy homedir, extractTxHash helper, validatePayAmount shared, verify loop rewrite, clearCatalogCache, connect error tests
- Desloppify R3 (2 agents): SSRF on apiBaseUrl, CatalogEntrySchema, isDemosError dedup, trending opportunities, src/lib restructured into 4 subdirectories
- Full 6-stage desloppify triage completed (strategize→observe→reflect→organize→enrich→sense-check)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| 4 parallel worktree agents for audit fixes | File clusters were independent | Serial execution (slower) |
| appendEntry helper over () => null pattern | Eliminates leaky abstraction | Keep () => null (reviewers flagged it) |
| DemosRpcMethods interface over individual casts | Single cast point, typed throughout | Keep (demos as any) per-call |
| src/lib/ subfolder restructure with re-export shims | Zero-breakage migration | Move files without shims (breaks imports) |
| Manual-override for desloppify review imports | External session path too complex | --external-start flow (durable but heavyweight) |

## Key Files Modified

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| src/toolkit/url-validator.ts | edited | createPinnedFetch, IPv6 bracket handling |
| src/toolkit/tools/pay.ts | edited | atomic reservePaySpend, static safeParse, isDemosError dedup |
| src/toolkit/tools/tip.ts | edited | RPC chain resolution, checkAndRecordTip migration |
| src/toolkit/sdk-bridge.ts | edited | DemosRpcMethods, D402ClientLike, extractTxHash, DAHR timeout, sanitizeUrl |
| src/toolkit/guards/state-helpers.ts | edited | safeParse reviver, DAY_MS, appendEntry, 128-bit hash |
| src/toolkit/tools/feed-parser.ts | created | Shared parseFeedPosts replacing 3x duplication |
| src/toolkit/tools/discover-sources.ts | edited | CatalogEntrySchema, clearCatalogCache, URL path fix |
| src/lib/auth/ | created | Subfolder for auth.ts, identity.ts |
| src/lib/llm/ | created | Subfolder for llm-provider.ts, llm-claim-config.ts |
| src/lib/attestation/ | created | Subfolder for claim-extraction, attestation-planner/policy |
| src/lib/scoring/ | created | Subfolder for scoring.ts, quality-score.ts |

## Learnings

- Desloppify subjective scores from --manual-override are provisional and reset on rescan. Need --external-start path for durable scores.
- Worktree merge conflicts are always additive when agents have file-exclusive ownership. Semantic conflicts (missing imports) are caught by tests.
- Fabric review_code and /simplify have zero finding overlap — complementary detection domains. Both should run on security-sensitive changes.
- The 6-stage desloppify triage is very thorough but takes ~30 min of CLI ceremony before any code fixing starts.

## Open Items

- [ ] Merge desloppify/code-health → main
- [ ] Get trusted review scores via --external-start path
- [ ] Fix 3 stale dimensions (design_coherence, error_consistency, logic_clarity)
- [ ] Grind remaining 37 R3 review items
- [ ] Continue src/lib/ restructuring (33 flat files remain)
- [ ] Test health improvements (connect error paths, concurrent reservePaySpend)
- [ ] PR2-5 migration (unblocked by audit cleanup)

## Context for Next Session

Marius wants to clear items 1-7 from the "what's next" list: merge branch, trusted review import, fix stale dimensions, grind remaining items, package organization, test health, type safety. The desloppify/code-health branch has 20+ commits with 1815 passing tests. All desloppify state (.desloppify/) is persisted. Start with `git checkout desloppify/code-health && desloppify next`.
