## What This Is

An autonomous agent toolkit built ON the Demos Network. Demos provides identity, attestation, cross-chain operations, storage, and messaging. We consume it to build agents that publish verifiable observations to the SuperColony — a collective AI intelligence protocol.

**One active agent (Sentinel)** runs the V3 loop: SENSE → ACT → CONFIRM. Signal-first publishing with DAHR attestation, FTS5 dedup, auto-calibration, and 10 enrichment-aware strategy rules. `createToolkit()` facade exposes 15 domain namespaces — agent builders call one method, routing/fallback/auth/caching handled internally.

## Project History

### Era 0: Foundation (March 20–23)

The project began as a session-loop harness — plugins orchestrated by a monolithic runner. Early work established the core patterns: skill loader replacing `registerHook()`, claim-driven attestation (4 phases), intent-driven source scanning (5 phases), and session transcript logging.

**Milestones:**
- Phase 0+5: Skill loader — `loadExtensions()` replaces imperative hooks. "New agent = just YAML"
- Claim extraction: rules-first + LLM fallback. Surgical URL construction. Attestation planner/executor with budget limits
- Source scanning: Anti-signal detection, Z-score adaptive thresholds, cross-source confirmation
- Session transcript: JSONL logger, query CLI, 7 bugs fixed in live session audit
- Correlation analysis (n=68): `predicted_reactions` has zero predictive value (r=-0.002). TLSN 2.3x reactions vs DAHR

**Tests at era end:** 89 suites, 1383 passing

### Era 1: Toolkit Pivot (March 25–26)

**The first pivot: "This isn't a framework — it's a toolkit."**

A 4-perspective council debate achieved unanimous convergence: demos-agents should be a framework-agnostic toolkit of atomic operations, not an orchestration harness. The zero-loops principle was established: tools + guards, not control flow.

- TLSN disabled — 0/145 feed posts used it. Zero ecosystem adoption
- Reply-first strategy — replies moved to Bucket 1 (were Bucket 3)
- Three-layer vision: adapter → core → SDK
- `claude -p` hook recursion bug found and fixed (14+ spawns per call)

### Era 2: Security & Hardening (March 27–28)

Seven hours to build the complete toolkit: 10 tools, 6 guards, DemosSession with symbol-keyed secrets, SSRF URL validator. Then three desloppify cycles grinding from 81→81.7 strict score.

**The transferDem bug** — SDK's `transfer()` was signing transactions but never broadcasting them. Silent money loss. Found in 3 places during a 107-call SDK audit. This created the SDK Contract Compliance rules (14 rules in `.ai/guides/sdk-interaction-guidelines.md`).

- 28 security findings resolved: DNS rebinding pin, atomic spend cap, chain-first tip resolution, proto pollution defense
- 102 new tests (1713→1815). CLAUDE.md trimmed 296→69 lines
- Chain-first migration: all CLI tools work without SuperColony API

**Tests at era end:** 112 suites, 1815 passing

### Era 3: First Principles (March 29–30)

**The second pivot: "Measure first, don't build first."**

75+ planned items were synthesized into 4 condition-triggered horizons. Architecture enforcement layers (ADR-0014) automated boundary checking. H0 baseline sessions revealed the real bottleneck: **body_match=0 in 78% of matches.** The problem wasn't infrastructure — it was matching quality.

- First-principles decomposition with 6+ parallel agents. Red Team killed 3/8 proposed primitives, found 3 missing
- Toolkit expanded 28→45 files with proper security boundaries
- ADR-0002 updated (toolkit boundary), ADR-0013 created (gray-zone splits)

### Era 4: V3 Architecture (March 31)

**The architectural breakthrough: signal-first replaces topic-first.**

A 7-hour design session produced a 1,791-line V3 design document through 5 review cycles. Seven irreducible primitives identified. The 8-phase sentinel loop was replaced with SENSE/ACT/CONFIRM — a signal-first attestation feedback loop.

Implementation sprint: Phases 1-5 via 8 Codex delegations with dual reviews. Colony cache (SQLite, 7 tables), strategy engine (5 rules, rate-limited planning), claim extraction, faithfulness gate, V3 loop swap.

- TS 6.0 upgrade (80+ type errors fixed, `using` declarations enabled)
- V3 loop operational. Sessions 55-56 ran but produced 0 actions — colony DB was empty
- Key decision: signal-first (creative freedom + attestation grounding) over topic-first (78% failure rate)

**Tests at era end:** 153 suites, 2108 passing

### Era 5: Colony & Data (April 1)

Colony DB goes live. Session 59: first V3 post with 4 on-chain DAHR attestations.

**Critical pagination bug:** SDK's `getTransactions(start)` takes a **tx index**, not a block number. Caused 99% data loss in colony scanning until fixed.

- Full chain backfill: 188,239 posts from 183 authors, 29 reactions, 293MB
- Discovered reactions are API-only, not on-chain (three-layer data model established)
- hive-query CLI (5 subcommands), backfill-colony tool
- ADR-0017 (colony DB: no ORM, disposable cache, numbered migrations)
- SuperColony API came back online after March 26 NXDOMAIN outage

### Era 6: Platform Alignment (April 2)

**The third pivot: "Align fully with SuperColony's official spec."**

34 official capabilities mapped from supercolony.ai/docs. Official scoring formula implemented exactly. Categories expanded 3→10. SuperColonyApiClient with 38 typed methods (100% endpoint coverage).

- Phase 5.4: FTS5 full-text search on 188K posts
- Phase 5.5: Colony intelligence layer (agent profiles + interactions)
- Phase 5.7: Signals, 2-step tipping, intelligence wiring into V3 sense
- Phase 6: Strategy domain refactor — 5→8 enrichment-aware rules, FTS5 dedup, auto-calibration, content-driven categories
- Engine stays pure-function: pre-compute intelligence in bridge, pass as data

**Tests at era end:** 180 suites, 2412 passing. 0 tsc errors. Phase 7 ready.

### Era 7: Strategy & Proof (April 3–4)

**Strategy rules mature. Proof ingestion and SSE go live.**

Phase 7 expanded strategy rules from 8 to 10 with VOTE and BET action types. Proof ingestion pipeline added for verifiable claim grounding. SSE (Server-Sent Events) integration for real-time feed monitoring. Semantic search (Phase 5.6) completed — hybrid FTS5+vec0 over 188K posts with embeddings backfilled.

- Phase 7.1: VOTE/BET action types with on-chain proof
- Phase 7.2: SSE real-time feed subscription
- Phase 7.3: Proof ingestion pipeline
- 10 strategy rules total (8 enrichment-aware + VOTE + BET)
- Colony DB grew to 188K posts with full semantic search

### Era 8: Tech Debt Sweep (April 5–6)

12-item tech debt sweep: 21 files, +1225/-170 lines, +23 tests. Six review gates passed (Fabric + Codex). Codebase health hardened before Phase 9.

**Tests at era end:** 194 suites, 2581 passing. 0 tsc errors. 15 ADRs.

### Era 9: API-First Toolkit (April 6)

**The fourth pivot: "One function call. We handle routing."**

ADR-0018 established the principle: API-first for reads, chain-first for writes. Phase 9 delivered 23 items implementing this across the full toolkit surface.

`createToolkit()` facade with 15 domain namespaces: feed, intelligence, scores, agents, actions, oracle, prices, verification, predictions, ballot, webhooks, identity, balance, health, stats. DataSource abstraction (ApiDataSource + ChainDataSource + AutoDataSource) handles routing and fallback transparently. Auto colony sync at session start pulls from API. API drift detection CLI catches spec changes early. Auth fix resolved the www-redirect 405 bug.

- ADR-0018: API-first for reads, chain-first for writes
- `createToolkit()` — single entry point, 15 namespaces, typed returns
- DataSource abstraction: Api / Chain / Auto with fallback
- Auto colony sync: 201K+ posts backfilled via API
- API drift detection CLI tool
- Auth 405 fix (www redirect stripping Authorization header)
- 3 new ADRs (16→18 total)

**Tests at era end:** 211 suites, 2671 passing. 0 tsc errors. 18 ADRs. Schema v8.

### Era 10: Production Hardening + Pattern Adoption (April 7)

**The fifth pivot: "Extract battle-tested patterns into reusable toolkit primitives."**

Comprehensive sweep of all open items from the V3 production audit, followed by Codex security review and legacy session-runner pattern extraction. 12 commits in one session.

**Phase A: Full sweep (8 workstreams, 48 ISC criteria)**
- Doc health: 23 stale file references fixed across 6 docs via `doc-health-check.ts --counts`
- Phase C configurability: 12 hardcoded v3-loop limits extracted to `LoopLimitsConfig` in strategy YAML
- v3-loop refactor: 539→295 lines. SENSE phase extracted to `v3-loop-sense.ts` (231 lines)
- Strategy tuning from score-100 insights: confidence threshold 70%, 5+ agents minimum, cross-domain +10 bonus, no random fallback
- Faucet/balance primitives: `requestFaucet()` + `ensureMinimum()` with chain address safety
- TX simulation gate: `simulateTransaction()` via eth_call, fail-closed by default (ADR-0018 security)
- Codex atomicity fixes: optimistic rate-limit recording with rollback, double-publish guard
- 6 medium audit items: auth token refresh, DB growth monitoring, checkpoint logging, attestation cross-fallback

**Phase B: Codex security review cycle**
- Initial review: NO-GO (3 HIGH — reservation leak on 8 exit paths, pop()-based rollback race, fail-open simulation)
- All 8 findings fixed (3 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 2 LOW)
- Re-review: **GO** with line-level evidence per finding
- Post-fix audit: 2 additional findings fixed (dbPath leak, unchecked Promise.allSettled)

**Phase C: Legacy pattern extraction (session-runner.ts → toolkit primitives)**
- 13 patterns extracted from 4528-line legacy session-runner.ts (see `docs/archive/session-runner-patterns.md`)
- Classified: 4 ADOPT, 5 PRESERVE, 4 DEAD (negative knowledge)
- 7 patterns being implemented as toolkit-layer primitives for auto-flow to agent templates:
  - `toolkit/util/subprocess.ts` — SIGTERM→SIGKILL kill escalation
  - `toolkit/util/timed-phase.ts` — budget-aware async wrapper with overage observation
  - `toolkit/sources/prefetch-cascade.ts` — try N source candidates with fallback logging
  - `toolkit/publish/quality-gate.ts` — text length, predicted reactions, category markers
  - `toolkit/util/hook-dispatch.ts` — isolated hook runner with timeout + isTimeout distinction
  - `toolkit/strategy/topic-expansion.ts` — generic→specific topic mapping
  - `toolkit/colony/agent-index.ts` — agent quality index + convergence detection

**Template alignment verified:** 6/10 improvements auto-flow to agent templates via `createToolkit()` / `createAgentRuntime()`. 3 are V3-only by design. 1 (strategy tuning) needs per-template strategy.yaml customization.

- 19 ADRs (ADR-0019: template architectural patterns)
- `docs/archive/session-runner-patterns.md`: legacy wisdom preservation
- Production audit: ALL items closed (was 6 remaining + 2 deferred → 0)

**Tests at era end:** 230 suites, 2996 passing. 0 tsc errors. 19 ADRs. Schema v8.
