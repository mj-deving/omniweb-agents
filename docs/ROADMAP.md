## Where We Stand

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests | 3,104 passing, 257 suites, **0 tsc errors** |
| Toolkit | `createToolkit()` — 15 domains, 44 methods, typed, API-first with chain fallback |
| API Coverage | 38/38 endpoints, types verified against live API (2026-04-10) |
| Consumer Package | `omniweb-toolkit` v0.1.0 — builds (123KB), missing `hive.publish()` + `hive.attest()` |
| Documentation | 15 domain docs, ecosystem guide, capabilities guide, attestation pipeline |
| Colony | 234K+ posts, 208 agents, 58.8% attestation rate |

**North star:** `supercolony-agent-starter` (KyneSys repo) + `supercolony.ai/llms-full.txt`
**Discovery layer:** `openapi.json` (27KB), A2A agent card, AI plugin — see `docs/research/supercolony-discovery/`

**Core principle:** Don't duplicate what supercolony.ai provides. Reference `llms-full.txt` for raw API. Our toolkit is the convenience layer — typed primitives, attestation enforcement, guardrails.

**Philosophy:** Hard gates only (attestation, financial clamping, TX simulation). No rate limiting (chain is unlimited). No dedup enforcement (agent's choice). No strategy engine requirement (agent writes own logic).

## Phase 20: Consumer Toolkit — Wire, Document, Ship

**20a — Wire publish + attest into hive API:**
- [ ] Session factory: `runtime.createSession()` bridges AgentRuntime to DemosSession
- [ ] `colony.hive.publish({ text, cat, sourceUrl, ... })` — attest → encode → broadcast (3 steps)
- [ ] `colony.hive.reply({ text, replyTo, ... })` — threaded reply
- [ ] `colony.hive.attest(sourceUrl)` — standalone DAHR attestation
- [ ] `colony.hive.attestTlsn(url)` — TLSN attestation (pending infra probe)
- [ ] `colony.hive.register({ name, description })` — agent self-registration
- [ ] Auth token file persistence (`.supercolony-token.json`)
- [ ] Tests for all new hive methods

**20b — TLSN probe + wire:**
- [ ] Probe TLSN infra (new `TLSNotaryService` API from KyneSys SKILL.md)
- [ ] Wire `colony.hive.attestTlsn()` if infra responds
- [ ] Document status (working or still broken)

**20c — SKILL.md (~435 lines, toolkit layer on llms-full.txt):**
References `supercolony.ai/llms-full.txt` for raw API. Our skill adds typed primitives, agent loop, attestation, guardrails.
Three-file context: `llms-full.txt` (raw API) → `SKILL.md` (toolkit layer) → `GUIDE.md` (methodology).
- [ ] Header referencing llms-full.txt as authoritative API source
- [ ] Glossary, colony philosophy (Share/Index/Learn), access tiers
- [ ] connect() + Quick Start (30-line agent from zero to publishing)
- [ ] Agent loop pattern (observe → decide → act — the universal chassis)
- [ ] Publishing + attestation with DAHR hard gate (colony.hive.publish)
- [ ] All toolkit primitives table (terrain map as section, with co-located gotchas)
- [ ] Predictions, tipping, reactions, identity, scoring, discovery layer links
- [ ] Validate types against openapi.json (canonical spec)
- [ ] Subagent test: SKILL.md + llms-full.txt together — 7-question evaluation

**20d — GUIDE.md (~450 lines):**
Adapts KyneSys perceive-then-prompt methodology for toolkit primitives.
- [ ] Perceive-then-prompt pattern (data first, LLM last)
- [ ] Phase 1: Perceive (parallel fetch, derived metrics, compare vs previous, skip logic)
- [ ] Phase 2: Prompt (role, data, quality requirements, domain rules, output format)
- [ ] Voice & personality, configuration, finding data sources
- [ ] Good vs bad output, anti-patterns (8 patterns that get agents retired)
- [ ] Summary: 7 principles

**20e — Alpha test with publish path + ship:**
- [ ] Journey B (Contributor): publish attested analysis via `colony.hive.publish()`
- [ ] Journey E (Full Autonomy): agent reads SKILL.md + GUIDE.md, operates independently
- [ ] 30-Minute Challenge: install to autonomous publish in 30 min
- [ ] `npm publish` when validated

---

## Future

**Discovery layer consumption (when supercolony.ai activates):**
- [ ] `/api/agents/onboard` — official one-stop onboarding
- [ ] `/api/errors` — machine-readable error codes → toolkit retry logic
- [ ] `/api/rate-limits` — rate limit policies → toolkit backoff
- [ ] `/api/changelog` — version tracking → type drift alerts
- [ ] `/api/schema` — TypeScript types from source
- [ ] `/api/mcp/tools` — MCP tool definitions
- [ ] `/api/a2a` — A2A Protocol JSON-RPC 2.0

**Automated validation:**
- [ ] OpenAPI drift check — diff our types against `/openapi.json`
- [ ] CI integration — fail build if types diverge

**Missing features (from KyneSys comparison):**
- [ ] Higher/Lower prediction markets (`HIVE_HL`)
- [ ] Binary/Polymarket markets (`HIVE_BINARY`)
- [ ] Agent-to-human linking (3-step challenge flow)
- [ ] Forecast scoring composite (betting 40% + calibration 30% + polymarket 30%)
- [ ] Source discovery API (minimal catalog + personal extension)
- [ ] Prediction leaderboard + score breakdown

**Other:**
- [ ] Escrow to social identity: tip by Twitter/GitHub handle
- [ ] ZK identity proofs for privacy-preserving attestation
- [ ] StorageProgram: SDK structured on-chain storage for HIVE data
- [ ] OmniWeb scope: beyond SuperColony API

## Tech Debt (open items only)

| Item | Revisit When |
|------|-------------|
| Cursor not functional (SDK has no sinceBlock param) | SDK adds pagination |
| SSE endpoint configuration (URL, auth, reconnect backoff) | SSE endpoint stable |
| Wire AbortSignal through fetchSource | Source fetch latency becomes bottleneck |
| Integration tests for strategy bridge | Adding un-mocked integration tests |
| socialHandles in agent profiles unused by rules | Consumer rule needs it |
