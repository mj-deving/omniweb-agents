# Session: Review Codex tmux backend, TLSN wiring, attestation quality guard

**Date:** 2026-03-13 06:15
**Duration:** ~45min
**Mode:** full
**Working Directory:** /home/USER/projects/demos-agents

## Summary

Continued from previous session (pioneer agent design + implementation). Reviewed and committed Codex's pending work from sessions 2-9, confirmed QUESTION category default, reviewed tmux exec backend + real TLSN pipeline wiring, and implemented HTTP response quality guard to prevent attesting error responses.

## Work Done

- Reviewed + committed Codex sessions 2-6 improvements: topic scooping, gate normalization, AGENT_NAME propagation (fac2d9c, +299 lines)
- Confirmed QUESTION as default category for pioneer auto-mode
- Pushed 4 pioneer commits to GitHub (03d8dea through fac2d9c)
- Created `claude-codex-coop/TASK-pioneer-calibration.md` for Codex handoff
- Reviewed master plan phases — Phase 4 complete, Phase 5 (Docs & Release) next
- Reviewed + committed Codex tmux exec backend + real TLSN pipeline wiring (5556fdd)
- Implemented attestation quality guard: reject non-2xx HTTP, detect auth/error JSON payloads (991be0a)
- Bumped TLSN Playwright timeout 90s → 120s
- Audited existing TLSN knowledge across repos — confirmed all implementation already exists
- Updated coop with TLSN knowledge index so Codex doesn't reinvent the wheel

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| QUESTION default for pioneer | Thesis-question framing already contains assertions; QUESTION lowers reply bar | ANALYSIS or mixed category selection |
| Reject non-2xx attestations | Codex found 401 responses being attested as "evidence" | Warn-only (rejected: garbage attestations hurt score) |
| Bump TLSN timeout to 120s | MPC-TLS takes ~60s, 90s too tight | 150s (overkill), retry logic (more complex) |

## Key Files Modified

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| tools/session-runner.ts | committed | Codex sessions 2-6: topic scooping, gate normalization, AGENT_NAME env |
| tools/gate.ts | committed | Focus-topic boost in checkSignalStrength |
| tools/lib/subprocess.ts | committed | env option for runTool child processes |
| tools/session-runner.ts | committed | Codex tmux exec backend (--exec-backend spawn|tmux) |
| tools/lib/publish-pipeline.ts | edited | HTTP status guard + JSON error body detection + real TLSN wiring |
| tools/lib/tlsn-playwright-bridge.ts | edited | Timeout 90s → 120s |
| claude-codex-coop/TASK-pioneer-calibration.md | created | Calibration tuning task for Codex |

## Learnings

- DAHR `startProxy()` passes through upstream HTTP errors without status checking — must guard explicitly
- Some APIs return 200 with JSON error bodies — need content-level guard too
- TLSN Playwright bridge is the bottleneck (MPC-TLS prover), not token/storage
- All TLSN knowledge already exists across 8+ files in the repo — must surface pointers, not reimplement

## Open Items

- [ ] Codex: investigate pioneer "No topics found in scan" (sessions 8-9)
- [ ] Codex: investigate category drift (session 7 emitted ANALYSIS not QUESTION)
- [ ] Codex: pioneer score 40 post — check attestation linking
- [ ] Pioneer calibration offset set to -11 by Codex — needs validation
- [ ] Phase 5: Docs & Release (README, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Context for Next Session

Phase 4 fully complete. Codex has calibration + debugging tasks. Next major milestone is Phase 5 (Docs & Release) or addressing the pioneer quality issues (empty scans, score 40 post, category drift). CLAUDE.md is 179 lines — slightly over target, may need hygiene pass.
