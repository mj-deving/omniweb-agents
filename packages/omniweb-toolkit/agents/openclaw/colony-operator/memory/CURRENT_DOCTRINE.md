Checkpoint PRs: `#360` — https://github.com/mj-deving/omniweb-agents/pull/360 (planning), `#371` — https://github.com/mj-deving/omniweb-agents/pull/371 (market-write merge checkpoint), `#372` — https://github.com/mj-deving/omniweb-agents/pull/372 (docs/proofs closeout checkpoint)

Purpose: hold the exact colony-operator re-entry truth so fresh sessions do not drift back into older premises.

## Current status quo

- `omniweb-toolkit` already has a broad SuperColony/Demos substrate.
- The main problem was **boundary blur**, not missing primitives.
- The preferred architectural pivot is **playbook-owned policy over a shared request/resolution/execution seam**.
- PR #360 persists the planning map, policy contract, and implementation plan. It is a **historical planning checkpoint**, not the current code frontier.
- Current shipped code truth is now:
  - read-first
  - no-spend by default on the maintained consumer/default proof path
  - an explicit policy layer that owns reads, conditions, routes, and full-surface action requests
  - an intent layer that normalizes those requests and abstracts routing to colony primitives
  - a shared seam that is landed through `5xp4.14`
  - substrate/runtime ownership of capability truth, readiness, execution, and verification
  - explicit capability/readiness truth before wallet-backed writes
- The docs/proofs realignment slice `5xp4.15` is now closed by PR #372.

## Canonical execution ladder

1. `omniweb-agents-5xp4.9` — PR1 request-contract seam (`PolicyActionRequest`, no behavior change) ✅ landed
2. `omniweb-agents-5xp4.10` — thin `minimal-agent.ts` into orchestration-only glue ✅ landed
3. `omniweb-agents-5xp4.11` — explicit TypeScript-first policy layer + colony-operator starter migration ✅ landed
4. `omniweb-agents-5xp4.12` — unify publish/reply/react executor + result envelope ✅ landed
5. `omniweb-agents-5xp4.13` — bring tip into the shared seam honestly ✅ landed
6. `omniweb-agents-5xp4.14` — bring market/bet writes into the same seam ✅ landed
7. `omniweb-agents-5xp4.15` — realign docs, proof surfaces, and bundle story around the new architecture ✅ landed

## Anti-drift rules

- Do **not** treat PR #360 as the current implementation frontier; it is planning context.
- Do **not** describe the present architecture as if `5xp4.9` were still upcoming.
- Do **not** revive old operator-core, launch-first, prompt-contract, or specialist-front-door premises as the next execution center.
- `5xp4.8` remains a maintained proof checkpoint, but it does **not** replace the landed `5xp4.15` checkpoint as the current architecture/documentation truth.
- When uncertain, re-read PR #360, PR #371, and the live Beads state before coding.
