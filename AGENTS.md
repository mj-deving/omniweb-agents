# AGENTS.md

Operational guide for coding agents working in this repository.

This file is the workflow companion to `CLAUDE.md`.

- `CLAUDE.md` is the baseline source for architecture, principles, and repo-wide rules.
- `AGENTS.md` is the baseline source for execution workflow, branch discipline, PR discipline, and beads usage.

## Mandatory Read Order

Before starting work:

1. read `CLAUDE.md`
2. read `AGENTS.md`
3. read the relevant package docs for the area being changed
4. inspect `bd ready`
5. inspect open GitHub PRs if recent work may overlap

There is currently no repo `MEMORY.md`.

## Coordination Model

This repository should not depend on manual Codex-to-Claude handoffs.

Shared state should come from:

- `main` for merged truth
- open GitHub PRs for in-flight work
- beads for live task selection and blockers
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` for operating rules

If an agent needs context, it should reconstruct it from those sources rather than waiting for a human relay.

## Current Operating Model

This repo now uses:

- `main` as the integration branch
- `bd` / beads as the live task tracker
- separate worktrees for parallel agent execution
- one small task per branch and PR
- PRs as the normal merge vehicle

Do not treat old stacked Codex branches as the default source of truth unless the user explicitly tells you to resume one.

## Beads Workflow

Use `bd` as the task authority.

Important commands:

- `bd ready --json` to see unblocked work
- `bd show <id>` to inspect one task
- `bd update <id> --claim` to claim a task
- `bd note <id> "..."` to leave execution notes
- `bd close <id> --reason "..."` when work is complete

Rules:

- always inspect `bd ready` before choosing work
- claim a task before starting implementation
- if new work is discovered, create or note a follow-up bead
- if a task is blocked, record the blocker in beads
- do not silently work on a task someone else has already claimed
- beads content should be treated as public workflow metadata
- never put secrets, credentials, tokens, or private operational notes into beads

## Branch / PR Discipline

For every task:

1. sync from `main`
2. create one task branch
3. make one coherent change
4. run the smallest meaningful validation
5. push and open one PR against `main`

Pattern:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c codex/<short-task-name>
```

Rules:

- one bead = one branch = one PR
- do not mix unrelated fixes
- if a task grows, split follow-up work into new beads and new PRs
- do not push directly to `main` unless the user explicitly instructs an emergency exception
- do not force-reset or discard user work

## PR-First Merge Model

PRs here are not primarily requests for manual line-by-line human review. They are the merge unit, audit trail, and task boundary.

Default expectation:

1. agent makes a scoped change
2. agent runs relevant checks
3. agent opens a PR
4. CI passes
5. the PR is merged or auto-merged to `main`

Preferred repo settings:

- protect `main`
- disable direct pushes to `main`
- require the CI checks you actually trust
- do not require human approval if the goal is zero manual review
- prefer squash merge for small scoped branches
- enable auto-merge

Merge responsibility:

- the agent that opened a PR may merge it once checks are green and conflicts are clear
- any agent may merge a green PR when acting as the current maintainer
- the human should only need to intervene for ambiguous product decisions, broken CI, or merge conflicts

## Worktree Cooperation

When more than one agent is active:

- use separate git worktrees
- keep code changes isolated per agent
- keep task state shared through beads and GitHub
- prefer disjoint file ownership when running in parallel

If two tasks would touch the same files heavily, serialize them instead of racing.

## Validation Ladder

Use the smallest relevant check first, then broader checks when justified.

For `packages/omniweb-toolkit`, important commands currently include:

- `npm run check:evals`
- `npm run check:package`
- `npm run check:release`
- `npm run check:live`
- `npm run check:live:detailed`
- `npm run run:trajectories -- --trace ./evals/examples/<scenario>.trace.json --scenario <scenario>`

For trajectory work:

- `evals/trajectories.yaml` is the maintained scenario source of truth
- packaged examples must stay aligned with it
- do not weaken coverage or naming enforcement just to pass checks

## Documentation Discipline

- keep the package as the primary authority for its public surface
- do not duplicate official platform facts when the package should layer on them
- keep repo-only research separate from shipped package docs
- if publish-facing behavior changes, update docs and checks in the same PR when possible

## Untracked / Local Artifacts

Treat these cautiously if present:

- `codex-full-review.md`
- `codex-pre-publish-review.md`
- `codex-sdk-investigate.md`
- `scripts/auth-refresh.ts`
- `agents/reference/scores.jsonl`
- `scorecard.png`

Default behavior:

- do not commit them casually
- only use the `codex-*.md` files if explicitly executing those review/investigation prompts
- treat `scripts/auth-refresh.ts` as experimental unless deliberately productized
- treat score/image artifacts as local data unless instructed otherwise

## Beads Storage Note

Current beads setup:

- local embedded beads database remains the live working database
- remote durability is provided by DoltHub backup
- there are currently no federation peers configured
- do not run `bd init --server` or reinitialize beads unless the user explicitly requests a backend migration

`--server` only matters if the repo intentionally moves from embedded local beads to a shared external Dolt SQL server as the primary live backend.
