## Tech Debt

| Item | Target | Metric |
|------|--------|--------|
| Double-fetch in V3 loop (scan-feed + colony ingestion both call getHivePosts) | 2026-04-14 | 14 sessions with >0 actions |
| Cursor not functional (SDK has no sinceBlock param) | When SDK adds pagination | Track SDK releases |
| Add composite index `(author, timestamp)` on posts for `resolveAgentToRecentPost` perf | When engagement volume grows | Query plan analysis |
| TLSN comparison: structural key-value matching instead of substring | Future | Substring injection risk on short values |
| DAHR/TLSN detection: require both url+responseHash for DAHR, serverName+recv for TLSN | Future | Reduce false positives on malformed tx |
| Concurrency guard: prevent double-processing in `ingestProofs` when scans overlap | Future | BEGIN IMMEDIATE or exclusion list |
| Edge case tests: DAHR empty data, TLSN empty recv, boolean snapshot values | Future | Test coverage gap |
| Integration tests for strategy bridge (briefingContext, identityLookup, targetType) | Future | Unit tests exist, integration tests missing |
| Identity API shape: v3-loop `identityLookup` may always produce `platform: "unknown"` | Next session | Verify against live API response shape |
| socialHandles in agent profiles unused by engine rules | Future | Infrastructure ready, no consumer yet |
| claim_ledger.verified based on self-reported snapshot, not chain-verified data (`scanner.ts`) | Future | Reconcile after ingestProofs runs |
| ~~API responses cast to generic T without runtime validation~~ | ~~Future~~ | **DONE 2026-04-04** — Zod schemas for 5 critical enrichment types in api-schemas.ts |
| ~~LLM prompt injection via briefingContext~~ | ~~Future~~ | **DONE 2026-04-04** — sanitized: strip control chars + injection tags, 500 char truncation |
| Cache contradiction scan results with TTL (avoid recomputing 188K posts each iteration) | Future | Review finding 2026-04-03 |
| SSE endpoint configuration (URL, auth, reconnect backoff) — endpoint not yet stable | Future | Review finding 2026-04-03 |
| Bet outcome tracking: reserve schema field for settlement status | Future | Review finding 2026-04-03 |
| Colony DB periodic pruning at scale (293MB and growing) | Future | Review finding 2026-04-03 |
| ~~publish-executor.ts at 792 lines~~ | ~~Future~~ | **DONE 2026-04-04** — split to publish-executor (431) + publish-helpers (323) + publish-types (78) |
| ~~v3-loop.ts at 618 lines~~ | ~~Future~~ | **DONE 2026-04-04** — split to v3-loop (499) + v3-loop-helpers (126) |

### Recently Resolved

| Item | Resolved |
|------|----------|
| Wire `ingestProofs()` into v3-loop | 2026-04-03 — wired in SENSE phase |
| Retry cap on retryable attestation failures | 2026-04-03 — retry_count in schema v6, 5-retry cap |
| Unified daily spending cap | 2026-04-03 — checkSessionBudget() in spending-policy.ts |
| Parallel RPC concurrency unbounded | 2026-04-03 — p-limit(5) in proof-ingestion-rpc-adapter |
| TLSN storage fee uncapped | 2026-04-04 — Math.min(storageFee, 15) cap |
| SSE feed event cast without schema validation | 2026-04-04 — Zod SSEPostSchema with safeParse |
| File paths leaked in error messages | 2026-04-04 — sdk.ts already sanitized, agent-config.ts redacted |
| Raw error .toString() coercion in event-service.ts | 2026-04-04 — err.message pattern |
| External JSON.parse without safeParse | 2026-04-04 — generic.ts/declarative-engine.ts are deprecated shims; source-discovery.ts already in try/catch; sse-feed.ts now uses Zod |
| Runtime guard for unrecognized targetType | 2026-04-04 — already has default case with skip + observe |
| Faithfulness gate has no chain verification dependency | N/A — by design, documented |

### Deferred Evaluation (assessed as acceptable — revisit periodically)

| Item | Original Assessment | Revisit When |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| `scoreAttestability` in thread-fan-out parallels `scoreClaim` in signal-first-pipeline | Intentionally different heuristics (attestability vs signal strength) | If scoring logic drifts or a unified scorer is needed |
| Two priority mutation patterns (briefing boost + leaderboard adjustment) | Info — no abstraction needed for 2 sites | If a 3rd priority modifier is added |
| `getRule` vs `findRule` near-duplicate in engine-helpers.ts | `findRule` fabricates default for rejection logging; different return type | If a 3rd lookup pattern is added |
| Stringly-typed targetType ("post"\|"agent") acceptable for 2 values | TypeScript union enforces compile-time | If a 3rd target type is added |
| Swallowed error in `resolveAgentToRecentPost` — no observer access | Standalone helper in action-executor.ts, can't thread observer | If debugging engagement failures |
| N+1 DB queries for agent profiles via `getAgentProfile` (uncached prepare per call) | Pre-existing pattern across colony modules | When profile count exceeds 50 per batch |
| `applyLeaderboardAdjustment` toLowerCase per entry — negligible at <100 entries | O(N) on small N | If leaderboard exceeds 1000 agents |
| Magic number '-48 hours' in `resolveAgentToRecentPost` | Acceptable hardcode for recency window | If window needs tuning per agent/config |
| Test policy objects use wrong property names (mocked — never type-checked) | Tests are green, mocked policy bypasses real validation | When adding un-mocked integration tests for spending policy |
| `defaultSpendingPolicy()` returns `dryRun: true` — budget guard is no-op by default | Intentional safe default — callers must explicitly opt in | When deploying VOTE/BET to production |
| `resolveAttestation` swallows exception details in catch blocks | Acceptable — returns typed failure reason | If debugging chain resolution issues |
| DAHR `compareProofToSnapshot` always returns "match" without URL check | Design choice: DAHR = hash-level trust, data not on-chain | If DAHR trust model changes |
| Fabric design: no multi-tenant data segregation | Single-agent system, no multi-tenancy requirement | If multi-agent support is added |
| Fabric design: document inconsistencies in phase7-design.md | Archive doc, iterative thought process, not blocking | Next doc cleanup |
| Fabric 8a design: decouple verification from scanner as independent worker | Intentional: incremental in caller, not a separate service | If attestation volume exceeds scan budget |
| Fabric 8a design: harden RPC client (mTLS, rate limiting, circuit breaker) | Generic infra concern, SDK abstracts the chain | If running own RPC node |
| Error handling: state-helpers parse error may leak partial content | Minor — key name already omitted | If state format becomes sensitive |
| Sequential proof ingestion + agent profile refresh in SENSE phase | Independent ops run serially; ~5-10s parallelizable | Next SENSE phase performance pass |
| Sequential source fetches in SENSE phase (serial HTTP in 15s budget) | Could parallelize with concurrency limiter for more coverage | Next SENSE phase performance pass |
| SQL placeholder interpolation in `getVerifiedPostCountsByAuthor` | Safe (`?` only) but prevents prepare caching across counts | If called frequently with varying author counts |
| `Promise<any>` at SDK boundary in proof-ingestion-rpc-adapter | SDK type genuinely unknown; downstream validates structure | If SDK adds TypeScript types for RPC |
| `hasColumn()` in schema.ts uses string interpolation in `db.pragma()` | Always hardcoded literal from migration functions | If hasColumn is generalized |
| N+1 `findContradictions` per (subject,metric) pair in contradiction scanner | Capped by maxResults:3 early-break; ~3 queries max per cycle | If claim_ledger grows beyond 500K rows |
| SSE adapter named "SSE" but uses poll-based `/api/feed` fetch | Reflects intended future SSE integration; poll is interim | When SSE endpoint is production-ready |
| `blockNumber: 0` sentinel for SSE-ingested posts | tx_hash PK handles dedup; blockNumber not used for ordering | If blockNumber becomes ordering-critical |
| `createLimiter()` concurrency semaphore in proof-ingestion-rpc-adapter | Generic reusable primitive; only one consumer currently | When a 2nd adapter needs concurrency limiting |
| `createTestDb()` and `addPost()` duplicated across test files | Test helper code, not production | Next test cleanup pass if 6+ files |

### Closed Deferred Items (2026-04-04 evaluation)

| Item | Disposition |
|------|-----------|
| `normalize()` not shared across codebase | **FIXED** — consolidated in engine-helpers.ts (2026-04-04) |
| 3 unwired modules (intelligence-summary, vote-bet-codec, napi-guard) | **DONE** — all wired in Phase 8d (2026-04-03) |
| VOTE/BET heavy path but no publish-executor handler | **DONE** — executor handler added (2026-04-03) |
| Array copy in `planThreadFanOut` sort | **Confirmed correct** — necessary to avoid mutating input |
| Quartile math on small leaderboards | **Confirmed correct** — rank 1 of 4 IS top quartile |
| `db.prepare()` not cached in ingestProofs | **Non-issue** — node:sqlite caches internally |
| Dynamic imports per v3-loop iteration | **Non-issue** — Node module cache after first load |
| `Promise.allSettled` type annotation in v3-strategy-bridge | **Non-issue** — TypeScript infers correctly |
| Inline `import(...)` type syntax in v3-loop.ts | **Non-issue** — valid TypeScript, not in v3-loop.ts |
| WHAT comments in proof-resolver.ts | **Not found** — comments removed or never existed |
| WHAT comments in contradiction-scanner and sse-sense-adapter | **Not found** — comments removed or never existed |
| VOTE/BET dry-run asymmetry vs PUBLISH | **By design** — VOTE/BET has no attestation pipeline |
| Fabric design: no documented API auth | **False positive** — wallet-signed, documented in SDK ref |
| Fabric design: no encryption-at-rest for ColonyDB | **Non-issue** — disposable cache per ADR-0017 |
| Fabric design: encrypt ColonyDB at rest | **Non-issue** — disposable cache per ADR-0017 (duplicate) |
| Fabric design: rate limiting undefined | **False positive** — fully implemented with hard clamping |

### Continuous Monitoring (no action needed — verify on each new addition)

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| SQL injection: all queries parameterized | Clean — 63+ queries audited 2026-04-03 |
| Secrets: no hardcoded keys, mnemonics, or API secrets | Clean — wallet loaded from file, never logged |
| Prototype pollution: safeParse on chain data | Active protection in place |
| Error handling: no stack traces or secrets in observe() calls | Consistent err.message pattern |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-03-30 | SENSE/ACT/CONFIRM replaces 8-phase V1 | 7 primitives to 3 phases; V1 had 5 ceremonial phases |
| 2026-03-30 | Signal-first publishing | Topic-first: 78% body_match=0. Signal-first: creative freedom + attestation grounding |
| 2026-03-30 | 1 post = 1 attestable claim | Focused, verifiable posts. Multi-claim to thread. |
| 2026-03-31 | Two executors (action + publish) | ENGAGE=1 call, PUBLISH=10 steps. Different complexity. |
| 2026-03-31 | SDK double-fetch acceptable (temporary) | Chain reads cheap. Consolidation target 2026-04-14. |
| 2026-04-01 | P0-P2 before Phase 6 | Strategy refactor needs data + tooling first |
| 2026-04-01 | No ORM for colony DB | Thin interface layer IS the abstraction |
| 2026-04-01 | Archive completed plan docs | design-loop-v3.md + phase5-plan.md to docs/archive/ (read-only reference) |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 5.7 before Phase 6 | API audit revealed broken tipping, missing signals/feed-search, unwired intelligence layer |
| 2026-04-02 | Signals are strategy-critical, not optional | /api/signals provides colony consensus -- must be primary input to plan phase |
| 2026-04-02 | Tipping must use 2-step API validation | Direct transferDem() skips spam limits and indexer can't attribute tips |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 6 is reference implementation, not canonical strategy | Toolkit/loop/primitives are universal; sentinel rules are ONE demo |
| 2026-04-02 | All enrichment is optional (graceful degradation) | Rules skip when apiEnrichment is null -- agent works without API |
| 2026-04-02 | Auto-calibration replaces static JSON | computeCalibration() in sense phase, cached in strategyResults |
| 2026-04-02 | Category selection is content-driven | inferCategory() replaces hardcoded "analysis" based on action reason |
| 2026-04-02 | Dedup module wired into publish-executor | checkClaimDedup + checkSelfDedup guard PUBLISH actions before LLM call |
| 2026-04-02 | SDK capabilities doc is informational only | XMCore/StoragePrograms/ZK are Phase 8+ -- no Phase 6 rules use them |
| 2026-04-02 | Engine stays pure-function: pre-compute in bridge | Engine's testability + agent-agnosticism is its strongest property. Bridge extracts intelligence data into DecisionContext fields. |
