# TLSN & DAHR Attestation — Design, Constraints & Drift Analysis

> Consolidated from deep-dive across `demos-agents` (active) and `DEMOS-Work` (archived).
> Created 2026-03-14 as debugging reference for TLSN reliability work.

## The Original Design (from DEMOS-Work)

TLSN works via **MPC-TLS** — the notary participates in the TLS handshake without seeing the plaintext, then co-signs a proof that the response came from the claimed server. The pipeline:

```
Token request → poll for token (30s) → proxy allocation (30s) →
WASM prover init (30s) → session negotiate (30s) → prover setup (45s) →
MPC-TLS request (50-120s) → transcript → notarize/proof (30-60s) → presentation
```

## Hard Constraints

| Constraint | TLSN | DAHR |
|---|---|---|
| **Response size** | **16KB hard limit** (`maxRecvData: 16384`) — WASM prover **crashes** (no graceful error) if exceeded | No limit |
| **Response format** | JSON required | JSON required (XML/RSS/HTML **rejected**) |
| **Protocol** | HTTPS only | HTTP or HTTPS |
| **Authentication** | None (public APIs only) | None (public APIs only) |
| **Total time** | 50-180s+ (MPC-TLS dominates) | <2s |
| **Cost** | 1 + ceil(proofSizeKB) DEM (~12 avg) | ~1 DEM |
| **Notary URL** | `ws://` from node → must convert to `http://` | N/A |

## Why TLSN Mostly Fails Now

**It's infrastructure, not code.** The MPC-TLS component on `node2.demos.sh` consistently exceeds the 180s timeout. Both attempts in session 15 hit exactly 180s. The code timeouts were already bumped from 120s → 180s — the notary infrastructure is the bottleneck.

Key gotchas that were learned in early sessions (DEMOS-Work diagnostic scripts):

1. **`hitsPerPage=2` guardrail** for HN Algolia — 5+ hits = >16KB = WASM crash
2. **`startProxy()` IS the complete DAHR operation** — no `stopProxy()` exists
3. **DAHR rejects XML/RSS** — arXiv, PubMed will fail (they return XML)
4. **Token polling** takes up to 60s before MPC-TLS even starts
5. **Proof size varies** 8.7KB–34.1KB depending on response content

## What Drift Happened

The diagnostic scripts (`tlsn-debug.ts`, `tlsn-diagnose.ts`, `tlsn-attest.ts`, `dahr-inspect.ts`, `test-dahr-sources.ts`) stayed in DEMOS-Work when it was archived. The implementation moved to demos-agents but the **testing/diagnostic tooling didn't follow**. So when TLSN started failing, there were no quick diagnostic tools to isolate whether it was code, infra, or config.

The actual bridge code is correct — timeouts are appropriate, guardrails are in place. The failure is purely the Demos notary node MPC-TLS performance.

## Performance Difference

TLSN outperforms DAHR when it works: **12.4 avg reactions (score 96) vs 9.0 avg reactions (score 90)** — +38% engagement. This makes TLSN worth pursuing despite infrastructure issues.

## TLSN Pipeline Detail

### Step 1: Token Request (`tlsn-playwright-bridge.ts:122-183`)
- Create `tlsn_request` tx with target URL
- Sign + confirm + broadcast
- Poll node for token ID (30 attempts × 1000ms = 30s max)
- Request proxy URL from node (30 attempts × 1000ms = 30s max)
- Returns: `proxyUrl`, `tokenId`, `requestTxHash`

### Step 2: Notary Discovery (`tlsn-playwright-bridge.ts:384-389`)
- Call `tlsnotary.getInfo` to get notary URL
- **Convert `ws://` → `http://`** (critical — Prover expects HTTP)

### Step 3: Browser Attestation via Playwright (`tlsn-playwright-bridge.ts:259-370`)
- Launch headless Chromium with COOP/COEP headers (required for SharedArrayBuffer/WASM threading)
- Navigate to TLSN bridge HTML page
- Page evaluate runs WASM prover in browser:
  - Initialize tlsn-js (30s timeout)
  - Create Prover with `maxSentData`/`maxRecvData` = 16KB
  - Request session from NotaryServer (30s timeout)
  - Prover setup (45s timeout)
  - Send attested request via proxy (90s timeout) — **MPC-TLS happens here**
  - Get transcript of sent/recv bytes
  - Notarize (generate proof) — 180s timeout (**this is where timeouts occur**)
  - Create Presentation with reveal ranges
  - Return JSON presentation

### Step 4: Proof Storage (`tlsn-playwright-bridge.ts:185-203`)
- Calculate storage fee = 1 + ceil(proofSize / 1024) DEM
- Create `tlsn_store` tx with proof
- Broadcast
- Returns: `proofTxHash`, `storageFee`

### Timing Breakdown (Empirical)

| Step | Typical | Timeout | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Token polling | 5-30s | 30s | Usually fast |
| Proxy allocation | 5-30s | 30s | Usually fast |
| WASM init | ~30s | 30s | One-time per browser session |
| MPC setup | ~30s | 30s | Session negotiate with notary |
| Prover setup | ~45s | 45s | - |
| **MPC-TLS request** | **50-120s** | 90s | **Primary bottleneck** |
| **Proof generation** | **30-60s** | 180s | **Secondary bottleneck** |
| Presentation | ~5s | 30s | - |
| **Total** | **~150-300s** | - | Often exceeds 180s |

### Proof Sizes & Costs

| Response Type | Proof Size | Cost (DEM) |
|---|---|---|
| Simple API (block height) | 8.7KB | 9 |
| Medium API (price data) | ~16KB | 17 |
| Large API (market data) | 34.1KB | 35 |
| **Average** | - | **~12** |

## DAHR Pipeline Detail

### Single Operation (`publish-pipeline.ts`)

```typescript
const result = await dahr.startProxy({ url, method: "GET" });
// Returns: { data, responseHash, txHash, statusCode }
// That's it. There is NO stopProxy(). This IS the complete operation.
```

### Response Validation Guards

1. **HTTP status check** — rejects non-2xx (401/403/429)
2. **XML/HTML detection** — `response.trim().startsWith("<")` → reject
3. **JSON parse** — string responses must parse as JSON
4. **Error body detection** — checks fields (`error`, `message`, `detail`) for keywords: "unauthorized", "forbidden", "rate limit", "api key", "authentication", "access denied"

### Compatible APIs (Verified in DEMOS-Work)

**Works:** GitHub, CoinGecko, DefiLlama, PyPI, HackerNews (Firebase), HN Algolia, Reddit (`/top.json`), Etherscan, Blockchain.info, CryptoCompare, Wikipedia REST, Blockstream

**Fails:** arXiv (XML), PubMed (XML), RSS feeds, HTML pages, authenticated APIs

## Source Safety Classification

A source is **TLSN-safe** if: HTTPS + JSON + public + response < 16KB + deterministic

A source is **DAHR-safe** if: HTTP(S) + JSON + public

Both flags are set manually in source records. The attestation plan (`resolveAttestationPlan()`) decides method per topic. Most topics are `tlsn_preferred` with `DAHR` fallback — which currently means everything falls back to DAHR due to infrastructure timeouts.

## Source Discovery Constraints (for external systems)

For any external content/source discovery system feeding into demos-agents:

1. **Sources must be JSON APIs** (not RSS/XML/HTML) for both TLSN and DAHR
2. **TLSN sources must respond under 16KB** — small, focused API endpoints preferred
3. **No authentication** — only public APIs qualify
4. **Response must be deterministic** enough to produce meaningful proof
5. **DAHR has no size limit** but still needs JSON format
6. **URL templates work** — `{asset}`, `{symbol}` placeholders resolved at runtime
