## Open Items

### Phase 5.6: Semantic Search (deferred)

- [ ] 5.6a -- Colony DB migration: sqlite-vec with 384-dim embeddings
- [ ] 5.6b -- Embedding pipeline: generate embeddings on insert
- [ ] 5.6c -- Hybrid search: FTS5 + vec0 via Reciprocal Rank Fusion

**Spec:** `docs/colony-tooling-plan.md` P5 + `.ai/guides/colony-db-research.md`
**Blocked by:** embedding model decision

---

### Phase 7: Strategy Phase 2 Rules — COMPLETE

- [x] 7a -- Event verifier for non-numeric claims (3-tier: field match, keyword, LLM semantic)
- [x] 7b -- Strategy Phase 2 rules (9 rules: 5 core + 4 enrichment-aware, all from design-loop-v3.md §6)
- [x] 7c -- Contamination check in faithfulness gate (unattested factual claims detected)
- [x] 7d -- Thread fan-out: `planThreadFanOut()` in `src/toolkit/publish/thread-fan-out.ts`
- [x] 6-defer-d -- adapt_to_leaderboard meta-rule: `applyLeaderboardAdjustment()` with YAML config
- [x] 6-disc-c -- Pluggable rule registry (YAML-based via `config-loader.ts`)
- [x] 6-disc-d -- Colony report consumption: `briefingContext` in DecisionContext, priority boost
- [x] 6-disc-e -- Identity lookup enrichment: `socialHandles` in agent profiles, `identityLookup` param
- [x] 6-disc-j -- ENGAGE txHash resolution: `targetType` discriminant + `resolveAgentToRecentPost()`

**Spec:** `docs/archive/design-loop-v3.md` sections 4-6 + `docs/archive/phase7-design.md`
**Completed:** 2026-04-03

---

### Phase 8: Advanced

- [x] 8a -- Proof ingestion: `resolveAttestation()` + `ingestProofs()` + schema v5 (chain_verified)
- [ ] 8b -- Contradiction detection in claim ledger
- [ ] 8c -- Verified engagement: agree/tip only after verifying target's attestation
- [ ] 8d -- Colony intelligence algorithm: smart scanning per `design-loop-v3.md` section 5
- [ ] 6-disc-a -- VOTE action type for price predictions (HIVE_BET memo, 5 DEM to pool)
- [ ] 6-disc-b -- Binary market bets (HIVE_BINARY memo, Polymarket integration)
- [ ] 6-disc-f -- XMCore cross-chain reads for on-chain data verification
- [ ] 6-disc-g -- SSE/webhook consumption for real-time reactive events (event-runner exists)

**Spec:** `docs/archive/design-loop-v3.md` sections 5+6b
**Blocked by:** Phase 7 (DONE)

---

### Future (no phase assigned)

- [ ] 6-disc-h -- Escrow to social identity: tip by Twitter/GitHub handle without wallet
- [ ] 6-disc-i -- ZK identity proofs for privacy-preserving attestation
- [ ] StorageProgram exploration: SDK structured on-chain storage for HIVE data

---

## Tech Debt

| Item | Target | Metric |
|------|--------|--------|
| Double-fetch in V3 loop (scan-feed + colony ingestion both call getHivePosts) | 2026-04-14 | 14 sessions with >0 actions |
| Cursor not functional (SDK has no sinceBlock param) | When SDK adds pagination | Track SDK releases |
| Wire `ingestProofs()` into v3-loop after scan completes | Phase 8b | Proof ingestion primitive exists but not called in production |
| Add composite index `(author, timestamp)` on posts for `resolveAgentToRecentPost` perf | When engagement volume grows | Query plan analysis |
| TLSN comparison: structural key-value matching instead of substring | Phase 8c | Substring injection risk on short values |
| Retry cap on retryable attestation failures (currently retries forever) | Phase 8b | Add retry_count column or age-based eviction |
| DAHR/TLSN detection: require both url+responseHash for DAHR, serverName+recv for TLSN | Phase 8c | Reduce false positives on malformed tx |
| Concurrency guard: prevent double-processing in `ingestProofs` when scans overlap | Phase 8b | BEGIN IMMEDIATE or exclusion list |
| Edge case tests: DAHR empty data, TLSN empty recv, boolean snapshot values | Phase 8b | Test coverage gap |
| Integration tests for strategy bridge (briefingContext, identityLookup, targetType) | Phase 8b | Unit tests exist, integration tests missing |
| Identity API shape: v3-loop `identityLookup` may always produce `platform: "unknown"` | Next session | Verify against live API response shape |
| socialHandles in agent profiles unused by engine rules | Phase 8c | Infrastructure ready, no consumer yet |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-03-30 | SENSE/ACT/CONFIRM replaces 8-phase V1 | 7 primitives to 3 phases; V1 had 5 ceremonial phases |
| 2026-03-30 | Signal-first publishing | Topic-first: 78% body_match=0. Signal-first: creative freedom + attestation grounding |
| 2026-03-30 | 1 post = 1 attestable claim | Focused, verifiable posts. Multi-claim to thread. |
| 2026-03-31 | Two executors (action + publish) | ENGAGE=1 call, PUBLISH=10 steps. Different complexity. |
| 2026-03-31 | SDK double-fetch acceptable (temporary) | Chain reads cheap. Consolidation target 2026-04-14. |
| 2026-04-01 | P0-P2 before Phase 6 | Strategy refactor needs data + tooling first |
| 2026-04-01 | No ORM for colony DB | Thin interface layer IS the abstraction |
| 2026-04-01 | Archive completed plan docs | design-loop-v3.md + phase5-plan.md to docs/archive/ (read-only reference) |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 5.7 before Phase 6 | API audit revealed broken tipping, missing signals/feed-search, unwired intelligence layer |
| 2026-04-02 | Signals are strategy-critical, not optional | /api/signals provides colony consensus -- must be primary input to plan phase |
| 2026-04-02 | Tipping must use 2-step API validation | Direct transferDem() skips spam limits and indexer can't attribute tips |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 6 is reference implementation, not canonical strategy | Toolkit/loop/primitives are universal; sentinel rules are ONE demo |
| 2026-04-02 | All enrichment is optional (graceful degradation) | Rules skip when apiEnrichment is null -- agent works without API |
| 2026-04-02 | Auto-calibration replaces static JSON | computeCalibration() in sense phase, cached in strategyResults |
| 2026-04-02 | Category selection is content-driven | inferCategory() replaces hardcoded "analysis" based on action reason |
| 2026-04-02 | Dedup module wired into publish-executor | checkClaimDedup + checkSelfDedup guard PUBLISH actions before LLM call |
| 2026-04-02 | SDK capabilities doc is informational only | XMCore/StoragePrograms/ZK are Phase 8+ -- no Phase 6 rules use them |
| 2026-04-02 | Engine stays pure-function: pre-compute in bridge | Engine's testability + agent-agnosticism is its strongest property. Bridge extracts intelligence data into DecisionContext fields. |
