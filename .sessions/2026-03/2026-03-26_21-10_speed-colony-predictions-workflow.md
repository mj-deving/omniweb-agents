# Session: Speed Fixes, Colony Intelligence, Prediction Markets, Workflow Finalization

**Date:** 2026-03-26 21:10
**Duration:** ~5 hours
**Mode:** full
**Working Directory:** /home/USER/projects/demos-agents

## Summary

Major productivity session: shipped 5 speed optimizations (~77s session savings), built colony intelligence foundation with triple-lens design analysis (BeCreative + Science + Council), added Polymarket + Kalshi prediction market sources, and concluded the quality review A/B trial (run both /simplify + Fabric review_code).

## Work Done

- **Speed fixes (5 changes):** Removed `--wait 15` from verify (V1+V2), reduced retry delays [5,10,15]s to [3,5,10]s, added `skipIndexerCheck` to PublishOptions (saves 30s/post), capped harden findings at 10 with phase_errors exempt + autonomous log-only mode, added sense cache on V2 resume (<5min reuse)
- **Colony intelligence module:** `src/lib/colony-intelligence.ts` — AgentProfile, RelationshipEdge, ColonySnapshot types, analyzeColony() for feed analysis, persistColony/loadColony with atomic write + corrupt JSON guard
- **Colony census script:** `scripts/colony-census.ts` — full feed analysis tool (blocked on supercolony.ai DNS outage)
- **Triple-lens colony design:** Ran BeCreative (TreeOfThoughts), Science (FullCycle with 7 hypotheses), Council (4-agent debate: Nash/Darwin/Barabasi/Vickrey) in parallel — converged on 3-layer Colony Mind architecture
- **Polymarket + Kalshi sources:** 2 YAML specs (polymarket.yaml: 3 ops, kalshi.yaml: 3 ops), 4 catalog entries (quarantined). Catalog now at 229 sources, 38 specs.
- **Quality review trial concluded:** /simplify and Fabric review_code have zero finding overlap — run both. Updated CLAUDE.md, dev workflow memory, review heuristics memory.
- **Docs sync:** INDEX.md updated (test counts, source counts, shipped items, TLSN status)
- **Stale blocker cleared:** Macro claim routing was already fixed in commit 12fe1d5 (2026-03-21)
- **DNS outage documented:** supercolony.ai NXDOMAIN globally since 2026-03-26

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Run both /simplify + Fabric review_code | Zero finding overlap (n=1); complementary detection domains | A/B alternate (original plan), Fabric only, /simplify only |
| Colony intelligence needs census before redesign | Colony size + power law determines entire architecture | Build speculatively (what I initially did) |
| Autonomous harden skips proposeImprovement | Each proposal spawns a subprocess (~1s each, 37 spawns = 37s). Log-only saves the data in session report. | Batch write (one subprocess), keep as-is |
| Polymarket/Kalshi as quarantined sources | New sources always start quarantined; auto-promote after 3 health checks | Active (skip validation) |
| Colony Mind 3-layer architecture | Triple-lens analysis converged: Map (positioning) → Ledger (relationships) → Pulse (network) | Single monolithic module, graph-first |

## Key Files Modified

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `cli/session-runner.ts` | edited | 5 speed fixes: --wait removal, skipIndexerCheck, harden cap, autonomous log-only, sense cache |
| `cli/verify.ts` | edited | Retry delays [5,10,15] → [3,5,10] |
| `src/actions/publish-pipeline.ts` | edited | skipIndexerCheck field + conditional gate |
| `src/lib/colony-intelligence.ts` | created | Colony analysis module (AgentProfile, RelationshipEdge, ColonySnapshot) |
| `scripts/colony-census.ts` | created | Full feed analysis script |
| `tests/speed-fixes.test.ts` | created | 10 tests for speed fixes |
| `tests/colony-intelligence.test.ts` | created | 9 tests for colony module |
| `src/lib/sources/providers/specs/polymarket.yaml` | created | 3 operations (markets-active, events-active, market-by-slug) |
| `src/lib/sources/providers/specs/kalshi.yaml` | created | 3 operations (markets, events, market-by-ticker) |
| `config/sources/catalog.json` | edited | +4 entries (229 total) |
| `docs/INDEX.md` | edited | Synced test counts, sources, shipped items |
| `CLAUDE.md` | edited | Dev workflow: both /simplify + Fabric review_code |

## Learnings

- supercolony.ai has NXDOMAIN at global DNS level — not a VPN issue, domain itself is down
- Fabric review_code and /simplify catch completely different bugs (zero overlap in n=1 trial)
- /simplify's killer feature: codebase-aware search for existing utilities. Fabric's: deep correctness + security.
- Triple-lens thinking (creative + science + council) produces far superior designs vs single-pass analysis
- Colony intelligence should be mechanism-first (optimize for what SuperColony rewards), not model-first
- The "60% of posts get 0 reactions" stat means biggest gain is 0→1 reactions, not 8→12
- Macro claim routing blocker was already fixed 5 days ago — stale MEMORY.md entries mislead

## Open Items

- [ ] Colony census (blocked on supercolony.ai DNS)
- [ ] Colony intelligence redesign with Layer 1 signals (after census)
- [ ] Toolkit MVP spec (ready for execution, design doc complete)
- [ ] Quality score data collection (17/20+ entries, blocked on connectivity)

## Context for Next Session

Speed fixes shipped, colony intelligence foundation built but needs redesign after census data. Polymarket + Kalshi sources added to catalog. supercolony.ai DNS is down globally — all API operations blocked. Toolkit MVP spec is the next big offline-capable task (design doc `docs/design-toolkit-architecture.md` has all answers). Run census immediately when connectivity restores.
