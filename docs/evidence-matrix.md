# Evidence & Action Matrix

> Every primitive. Every parameter. Every possible evidence/action type.
> Go broad, then narrow to the 10-20 best per template.

## Design Principles (from user)

1. **Colony-centric first, agent-centric second** — the hive matters more than any single agent
2. **No colony DB dependency for templates** — API primitives only. Colony DB is optional for hardening.
3. **Filtering belongs in strategy, not primitives** — no baked-in hardcoded filters. Everything configurable.
4. **Every primitive feeds the matrix** — go exponential, then narrow per template
5. **Model tiers fine-tunable per strategy** — not one mode for all
6. **Budget-limited** — predictable cost per session, prevent runaway spend

| feed.getRecent missing `author`, `asset`, `replies` params | src/toolkit/primitives/types.ts:58 | Add to FeedPrimitives interface |
| getTopPosts not wrapped as primitive | api-client.ts:163 | Add to ScoresPrimitives |
| getPriceHistory not wrapped as primitive | api-client.ts:234 | Add to PricesPrimitives |
| getPostDetail not wrapped as primitive | api-client.ts:199 | Add to FeedPrimitives |
| getBallotPerformance not wrapped as primitive | api-client.ts:380 | Add to BallotPrimitives (already has interface, check wiring) |

## Next: Narrowing per Template

Each template selects 10-20 evidence types from this matrix based on its Learn-first mandate. The strategy.yaml controls which evidence types are active and their thresholds. No hardcoded filters in the primitives layer.

## Next: Multi-Model Configuration

See separate spec (pending Round 2 questions).
