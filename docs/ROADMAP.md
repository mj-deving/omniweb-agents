## Tech Debt

| Item | Target | Metric |
|------|--------|--------|
| Double-fetch in V3 loop (scan-feed + colony ingestion both call getHivePosts) | 2026-04-14 | 14 sessions with >0 actions |
| Cursor not functional (SDK has no sinceBlock param) | When SDK adds pagination | Track SDK releases |
| Wire `ingestProofs()` into v3-loop after scan completes | Phase 8b | Proof ingestion primitive exists but not called in production |
| Add composite index `(author, timestamp)` on posts for `resolveAgentToRecentPost` perf | When engagement volume grows | Query plan analysis |
| TLSN comparison: structural key-value matching instead of substring | Phase 8c | Substring injection risk on short values |
| Retry cap on retryable attestation failures (currently retries forever) | Phase 8b | Add retry_count column or age-based eviction |
| DAHR/TLSN detection: require both url+responseHash for DAHR, serverName+recv for TLSN | Phase 8c | Reduce false positives on malformed tx |
| Concurrency guard: prevent double-processing in `ingestProofs` when scans overlap | Phase 8b | BEGIN IMMEDIATE or exclusion list |
| Edge case tests: DAHR empty data, TLSN empty recv, boolean snapshot values | Phase 8b | Test coverage gap |
| Integration tests for strategy bridge (briefingContext, identityLookup, targetType) | Phase 8b | Unit tests exist, integration tests missing |
| Identity API shape: v3-loop `identityLookup` may always produce `platform: "unknown"` | Next session | Verify against live API response shape |
| socialHandles in agent profiles unused by engine rules | Phase 8c | Infrastructure ready, no consumer yet |
| TLSN storage fee uncapped — large proof = unbounded DEM cost (`tlsn-playwright-bridge.ts:298`) | Phase 8b | Add Math.min(storageFee, 15) cap |
| claim_ledger.verified based on self-reported snapshot, not chain-verified data (`scanner.ts:191`) | Phase 8b | Reconcile after ingestProofs runs |
| API responses cast to generic T without runtime validation (`api-client.ts:458`) | Phase 8c | Add Zod schemas for critical endpoints |
| External JSON.parse without safeParse in provider files (`generic.ts:93`, `declarative-engine.ts:1215`, `source-discovery.ts:80`, `sse-feed.ts:135`) | Phase 8c | Use safeParse() for external HTTP bodies |
| File paths leaked in error messages (`sdk.ts:83,167`, `agent-config.ts:405`) | Phase 8c | Redact absolute paths |
| No unified daily spending cap across tips + attestations + D402 + gas | Future | Theoretical daily max is unbounded due to TLSN + D402 |
| Runtime guard for unrecognized targetType values in action-executor ENGAGE case | Phase 8b | TypeScript enforces at compile time, no runtime check |
| LLM prompt injection via briefingContext (`.slice(500)` truncated but unsanitized) | Phase 8c | Consider delimiter/system instruction boundary |
| Parallel RPC concurrency unbounded in ingestProofs beyond limit param | Phase 8b | Add p-limit or document safe threshold |
| Raw error `.toString()` coercion in `eliza/event-service.ts:55` | Phase 8c | Use `.message` pattern |
| SSE feed event cast without schema validation (`sse-feed.ts:135`) | Phase 8c | Add Zod schema for SSEPost |
| Faithfulness gate has no chain verification dependency (by design, pre-publish) | N/A | Document that gate output is NOT chain-verified |

### Deferred Evaluation (assessed as acceptable — revisit periodically)

| Item | Original Assessment | Revisit When |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| `normalize()` not shared across codebase — each module has local trim+lowercase | Pre-existing, large blast radius to consolidate | When adding new modules that need normalization |
| `scoreAttestability` in thread-fan-out parallels `scoreClaim` in signal-first-pipeline | Intentionally different heuristics (attestability vs signal strength) | If scoring logic drifts or a unified scorer is needed |
| Two priority mutation patterns (briefing boost + leaderboard adjustment) | Info — no abstraction needed for 2 sites | If a 3rd priority modifier is added |
| `getRule` vs `findRule` near-duplicate in engine.ts | Pre-existing, `findRule` fabricates default for rejection logging | Next engine refactor |
| Stringly-typed targetType ("post"\|"agent") acceptable for 2 values | TypeScript union enforces compile-time | If a 3rd target type is added |
| Swallowed error in `resolveAgentToRecentPost` — no observer access | Function is a standalone helper, can't thread observer | If debugging engagement failures |
| N+1 DB queries for agent profiles via `getAgentProfile` (uncached prepare per call) | Pre-existing pattern across colony modules | When profile count exceeds 50 per batch |
| `db.prepare()` not cached across repeated `ingestProofs` calls | better-sqlite3 caches internally, LOW severity | If profiling shows prepare() as bottleneck |
| Array copy in `planThreadFanOut` sort — necessary to avoid mutating input | Correct behavior, confirmed by reviewer | Never — this is right |
| `applyLeaderboardAdjustment` toLowerCase per entry — negligible at <100 entries | O(N) on small N | If leaderboard exceeds 1000 agents |
| Magic number '-48 hours' in `resolveAgentToRecentPost` | Acceptable hardcode for recency window | If window needs tuning per agent/config |
| Inline `import(...)` type syntax in v3-loop.ts | Readability preference, not a bug | Next v3-loop refactor |
| `Promise.allSettled` type annotation in v3-strategy-bridge | Trivial readability suggestion | Never — not blocking |
| WHAT comments in proof-resolver.ts (2 inline comments restate code) | Cosmetic, function docstring already covers | Next code cleanup pass |
| `resolveAttestation` swallows exception details in catch blocks | Acceptable — returns typed failure reason | If debugging chain resolution issues |
| DAHR `compareProofToSnapshot` always returns "match" without URL check | Design choice: DAHR = hash-level trust, data not on-chain | If DAHR trust model changes |
| Quartile math on small leaderboards (index 0 in 4 agents = top quartile) | Mathematically correct: rank 1 of 4 IS top quartile | Never — this is right |
| Fabric design: no documented API auth/authorization | False positive — wallet-signed requests, documented in SDK reference | Never |
| Fabric design: no encryption-at-rest for ColonyDatabase | Colony DB is disposable local cache per ADR-0017, not secrets | Never |
| Fabric design: no multi-tenant data segregation | Single-agent system, no multi-tenancy requirement | If multi-agent support is added |
| Fabric design: rate limiting undefined | False positive — fully implemented with hard clamping | Never |
| Fabric design: document inconsistencies in phase7-design.md | Design doc shows iterative thought process, not blocking | Next doc cleanup |
| Fabric 8a design: decouple verification from scanner as independent worker | Intentional: incremental in caller, not a separate service | If attestation volume exceeds scan budget |
| Fabric 8a design: harden RPC client (mTLS, rate limiting, circuit breaker) | Generic infrastructure concern, SDK abstracts the chain | If running own RPC node |
| Fabric 8a design: encrypt ColonyDB at rest | Same as above — disposable cache per ADR-0017 | Never |
| SQL injection audit: all 63 queries clean | No issue — all parameterized | Continuous — check on every new query |
| Secrets audit: no hardcoded keys, mnemonics, or API secrets | No issue — wallet loaded from file, never logged | Continuous |
| Secrets audit: prototype pollution protected via safeParse on chain data | No issue — active protection in place | Continuous |
| Error handling: no stack traces leaked, no secrets in observe() calls | No issue — consistent err.message pattern | Continuous |
| Error handling: state-helpers parse error may leak partial content | Minor — key name already omitted | If state format becomes sensitive |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-03-30 | SENSE/ACT/CONFIRM replaces 8-phase V1 | 7 primitives to 3 phases; V1 had 5 ceremonial phases |
| 2026-03-30 | Signal-first publishing | Topic-first: 78% body_match=0. Signal-first: creative freedom + attestation grounding |
| 2026-03-30 | 1 post = 1 attestable claim | Focused, verifiable posts. Multi-claim to thread. |
| 2026-03-31 | Two executors (action + publish) | ENGAGE=1 call, PUBLISH=10 steps. Different complexity. |
| 2026-03-31 | SDK double-fetch acceptable (temporary) | Chain reads cheap. Consolidation target 2026-04-14. |
| 2026-04-01 | P0-P2 before Phase 6 | Strategy refactor needs data + tooling first |
| 2026-04-01 | No ORM for colony DB | Thin interface layer IS the abstraction |
| 2026-04-01 | Archive completed plan docs | design-loop-v3.md + phase5-plan.md to docs/archive/ (read-only reference) |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 5.7 before Phase 6 | API audit revealed broken tipping, missing signals/feed-search, unwired intelligence layer |
| 2026-04-02 | Signals are strategy-critical, not optional | /api/signals provides colony consensus -- must be primary input to plan phase |
| 2026-04-02 | Tipping must use 2-step API validation | Direct transferDem() skips spam limits and indexer can't attribute tips |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 6 is reference implementation, not canonical strategy | Toolkit/loop/primitives are universal; sentinel rules are ONE demo |
| 2026-04-02 | All enrichment is optional (graceful degradation) | Rules skip when apiEnrichment is null -- agent works without API |
| 2026-04-02 | Auto-calibration replaces static JSON | computeCalibration() in sense phase, cached in strategyResults |
| 2026-04-02 | Category selection is content-driven | inferCategory() replaces hardcoded "analysis" based on action reason |
| 2026-04-02 | Dedup module wired into publish-executor | checkClaimDedup + checkSelfDedup guard PUBLISH actions before LLM call |
| 2026-04-02 | SDK capabilities doc is informational only | XMCore/StoragePrograms/ZK are Phase 8+ -- no Phase 6 rules use them |
| 2026-04-02 | Engine stays pure-function: pre-compute in bridge | Engine's testability + agent-agnosticism is its strongest property. Bridge extracts intelligence data into DecisionContext fields. |
